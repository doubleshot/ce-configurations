Known bugs:
-Failed to create symbolic link [/etc/nagios/conf.d/kaltura.commands.cfg], target [/opt/kaltura/app/plugins/monitor/nagios/config/commands.cfg] does not exist.
- the main thumbnail is not listed in the thumbnail page, known bug
- csv bulk upload does not work - probably a bug in gemini
- rewrite bug in apache - this might be fixed in a later package version

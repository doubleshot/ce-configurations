This is a mini howto for using the auto Kaltura OnPrem auto installer.

Pre-reqs:
=========
Download the OnPrem package from:
http://ciserver:9090/job/Kaltura-OnPrem-Falcon-Package/148/artifact/output/TM-v6.0.1-QA-148.tgz

Note that this requires VPN access to the IL intra. If you do not have creds, please contact Shlomi Ben David <Shlomi.Ben.David@kaltura.com>.

The auto install files can be obtained from:
svn+ssh://kelev.kaltura.com/usr/local/kalsource/backend/server/trunk/on-premise/all/auto_install
If you do not have an SVN account on kelev, please contact Shlomi Ben David <Shlomi.Ben.David@kaltura.com>.
Files should be placed under the basedir of the OnPrem archive. For instance, if you extracted the package to:
tar zxvf /tmp/TM-v6.0.1-QA-148.tgz -C /tmp/
Auto installer should be placed under: /tmp/Kaltura-TM-v6.0.1

Before running the installer, one needs to edit user_input.ini. 
A sample file can be found under:
svn+ssh://kelev.kaltura.com/usr/local/kalsource/backend/server/trunk/on-premise/all/auto_install/

To run the auto installer, type as super user:
# ./main.sh
You will be presented with the following options:

0. install an all in 1 instance
1. batch instance
2. sphinx instance
3. API machine
4. export Kaltura's MySQL DBs
5. configure MySQL && Sphinx for this host
